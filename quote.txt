🐾 **Animal Fact:**  Pandas have plantigrade feet. This means their entire foot (toes and heel) touches the ground when walking, which is similar to the way humans, other bears, and rodents walk. Other animals, such as dogs, cats, and horses walk with their weight on their toes.  <br/> <br/>*Last Updated:  Mon Feb 02 01:45 PT*
