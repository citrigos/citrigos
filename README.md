🐾 **Animal Fact:**  Giant pandas have been driven out of the lowland areas where they used to live and now are found only in the Chinese provinces of Sichuan, Gansu, and Shaanxi. The forests in these provinces are very damp and rainy. In one year, a forest may receive up to 50 inches of rain and snow.  <br/> <br/>*Last Updated:  Tue Feb 17 18:01 PT*
