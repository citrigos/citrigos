🐾 **Animal Fact:**  Besides whiskers on their legs, foxes also use Earth’s magnetic field to hunt their prey. Foxes leap up and pounce on their prey. They can leap in any direction, but they’re more likely to jump towards the northeast, where 72 of their attacks were successful.  <br/> <br/>*Last Updated:  Mon Feb 16 17:57 PT*
