🐾 **Animal Fact:**  While it is commonly thought that the ancient Egyptians were the first to domesticate cats, the oldest known pet cat was recently found in a 9,500-year-old grave on the Mediterranean island of Cyprus. This grave predates early Egyptian art depicting cats by 4,000 years or more.  <br/> <br/>*Last Updated:  Thu Feb 05 07:39 PT*
