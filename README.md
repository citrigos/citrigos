🐾 **Animal Fact:**  It has been illegal to kill pandas in China since the 1960s, but the laws were not enforced strictly. In 1987, the laws were strengthened to increase punishment from two years to a life sentence or even death. Today the punishment is less severe: 10-20 years in prison.  <br/> <br/>*Last Updated:  Mon Feb 09 07:54 PT*
