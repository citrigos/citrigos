🐾 **Animal Fact:**  Approximately 200 people have died since 1988 because of airborne collision between airplanes and birds. Bird strikes cause $300 million of damage each year to aircraft. The first recorded bird strike was in 1905, when Orville Wright’s plane hit a bird and killed it.  <br/> <br/>*Last Updated:  Thu Feb 05 22:52 PT*
