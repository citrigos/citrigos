🐾 **Animal Fact:**  The gestation period for giant pandas varies from 97-163 days. This wide range is due to delayed implantation, which means that after a giant panda becomes pregnant, the cub starts to grow only if the mother panda is able to get enough food. Once the cub starts to develop, it takes about 45-60 days before it is born.  <br/> <br/>*Last Updated:  Thu Feb 12 20:51 PT*
