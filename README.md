🐾 **Animal Fact:**  It was not until the 20th century that giant pandas became known to the rest of the world outside of China. The first live giant Panda to leave China in 1936 was named Su-Lin (“a little bit of something very cute”). He arrived at the Brookfield Zoo in Chicago.  <br/> <br/>*Last Updated:  Fri Feb 20 20:25 PT*
